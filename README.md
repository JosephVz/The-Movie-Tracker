## Description

Welcome to the Movie Tracker App - your one-stop solution to find where your favorite movies are streaming along with memorable quotes from the film!

# Overview
As fellow film lovers, we designed this web application to allow users to search for a movie title and discover where it is currently streaming. In addition to streaming information, the app provides a quote from the movie to add a touch nostalgia and excitement. 

# Features

- *Streaming Platforms:* Discover which platforms are currently streaming the movie you're interested in.
- *Movie Quotes:* Get a taste of the movie with a memorable Quote displayed alongside streaming details. 
- *Save Titles:* Save your favorite movie titles in a watch list for easy access.
